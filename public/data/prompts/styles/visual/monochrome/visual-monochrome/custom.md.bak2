Design a monochrome-only interface using TailwindCSS. Work strictly with black, white, and neutral grays—no color accents. The page should feel editorial, structured, and confident, relying on typography, spacing, and line work instead of color. Include a hero, feature modules, data or content grids, a narrative strip or case study, and clear CTAs.

Visual language
- Palette: pure white backgrounds, neutral grays for layering, deep black for text and strokes. Use opacity to shape hierarchy (e.g., 10–30% strokes for secondary lines).
- Forms: rectilinear or lightly rounded corners (6–10px). Avoid glass, glows, heavy shadows, or gradients; depth is conveyed by spacing and strokes.
- Rhythm: generous negative space, consistent vertical spacing (16/24/32px steps), tight alignment, and measured line lengths (60–72ch body).
- Tone: crisp, factual, minimal. Let content and structure speak; avoid decorative flourishes.

Layout blueprint
- Navigation: sticky bar with wordmark, key links, search, and a ghost button. Provide a compact menu on mobile. Focus ring must be visible on all controls.
- Hero: bold headline (38–54px) with tight leading, short supporting text, and dual CTAs (filled + outline). Optional monochrome illustration, photo, or geometric collage. Keep hero height breathable (70–80vh max).
- Feature grid: 3–6 cards describing product pillars or services. Each card includes title, concise body, and a small action. If using imagery, convert to grayscale with consistent aspect ratios (`aspect-[4/3]` or `3/2`).
- Data band: simple tables or stat tiles in black/white. Use stroke charts, dotted baselines, and monospace numbers. Status changes (+12%, -5%) shown via label text and weight, not color.
- Case study/story strip: two-column block pairing a grayscale mock with a succinct narrative (problem, approach, outcome). Provide “View details” CTA.
- Secondary modules: FAQs (bordered accordions), testimonials (italic pull quotes), or timeline (vertical line with outlined nodes). Maintain strict alignment and subtle dividers.
- CTA/footer: concise final CTA with email/social icons as outlined circles. Include form with clear errors/success states and visible focus outlines.

Typography & hierarchy
- Typeface: modern sans with 500/600/700 weights. Use monospace for timestamps, IDs, and metrics to improve alignment.
- Headings: tight tracking, uppercase labels for section headers with micro letter spacing. Body set to 16–17px with 1.6–1.7 line height; keep subheads shorter than body width.
- Balance text across lines (`text-balance` where available) and avoid long centered paragraphs; left alignment preferred.

Components & states
- Buttons: filled (black bg, white text) and outline (1px black stroke). Hover deepens fill or strengthens stroke; active nudges 1–2px. Focus-visible outlines 2–3px mid-gray/black.
- Cards: `rounded-lg border border-black/10 bg-white p-5 md:p-6` or `bg-neutral-50`. Hover: `-translate-y-1` and slight stroke opacity increase.
- Tabs/segmented: underline or pill highlight via stroke/weight, no color fills. Active tab may invert (black bg, white text).
- Inputs: `border border-black/15 rounded-md bg-white px-4 py-3` with `focus-visible:outline outline-2 outline-offset-2`.
- Tables/lists: `divide-y divide-neutral-200/70` with header weight 600. Allow zebra rows via light gray backgrounds only.
- Chips: outline-only with uppercase microcopy; use to flag status (New, Beta, Stable) without color coding.

Imagery handling
- Convert all imagery to grayscale; prefer high-contrast photography or wireframe-like mockups. Avoid blur/glow overlays.
- If text sits on imagery, add black/white scrim 70–80% for legibility. Keep masks rectangular or simple geometric.

Motion
- Motion is restrained: 160–220ms ease-out with small translate/opacity shifts. No bounce, no neon effects. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Line-drawing or gentle reveal animations are acceptable for icons/graphs, kept minimal.

Accessibility
- Maintain contrast ≥ 4.5:1. Ensure focus indicators are visible on all backgrounds. Provide alt text, aria-labels for icon-only buttons, logical tab order, and minimum 44px targets.
- Do not rely on color for state; pair text/icons/weight for errors, warnings, or success.

Responsive behavior
- Mobile: stack sections; collapse nav to a clean drawer; allow horizontal scroll for cards with clear scroll hints. Keep CTAs full-width if space is tight.
- Tablet: 2–3 column grids; keep buttons aligned; ensure tables remain readable (wrap or pivot to stacked cards).
- Desktop: leverage `max-w-6xl/7xl` containers, consistent gutters (24–32px), and occasional asymmetric compositions for interest.

Content guidance
- Lead with value, then evidence: capabilities, shipped outcomes, metrics. Keep microcopy precise (“View details”, “Download report”, “Open dashboard”).
- Support short metadata rows (Role, Year, Platform) using monospace for alignment.
- Keep CTA copy direct and confidence-building; avoid excessive adjectives.

Tailwind helper suggestions (non-binding)
- Container: `mx-auto max-w-6xl px-6 lg:px-10`
- Hero grid: `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-10 items-center`
- Cards: `rounded-lg border border-black/10 bg-white p-6 transition hover:-translate-y-1`
- Tables: `text-sm leading-6 divide-y divide-neutral-200/70` with `font-mono` stats
- Buttons: `inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full px-5 py-3 font-semibold transition`

Deliver an interface that proves hierarchy and interaction without any color, celebrating clarity, spacing, and typographic discipline.
