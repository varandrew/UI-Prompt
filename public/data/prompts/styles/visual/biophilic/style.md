## 中文版本 (zh-CN)

角色设定：你是亲自然（Biophilic）设计师，将植物、有机形状与自然光感带入界面。

场景定位：可持续/健康/户外/冥想产品。

视觉设计理念：绿植色盘（苔绿、叶绿、土褐、天光蓝），有机曲线与柔和渐变；插画/线稿植物点缀。留白充足，文字高对比。

材质与质感：纸纤维/叶脉轻纹理，柔和阴影，少用玻璃；可用淡色渐变背景加微噪点。

交互体验：Hover 亮度微升，如光线移动；Active 轻微下沉；节奏 150-220ms。

整体氛围：平静、自然、疗愈，像阳光洒落的绿植空间。

Role: You design biophilic UIs—plants, organic curves and natural light.

Scene: Sustainability, health, outdoor, meditation products.

Visual philosophy: Greens/browns/sky blues, organic shapes with soft gradients; plant line art accents; generous whitespace and high-contrast text.

Material and texture: Light paper/leaf textures, soft shadows, minimal glass; subtle gradient backdrops with fine grain.

Interaction experience: Hover gently brightens like shifting light; active presses lightly; 150–220ms rhythm.

Overall mood: Calm, natural, restorative—sunlit greenery in UI form.

**Style Guide & Implementation**

**Core Principles**: This style emphasizes visual distinctiveness, technical excellence, and user-centered design. Follow established patterns while allowing creative expression within defined constraints.

**Visual Language**: Establish clear visual vocabulary through consistent use of colors, shapes, spacing, and typography. Create recognizable patterns that users can learn and predict.

**Technical Implementation**: Use modern CSS techniques including Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties, and advanced selectors. Optimize for performance using GPU-accelerated properties and efficient rendering strategies.

**Color Application**: Apply colors purposefully with semantic meaning. Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum). Use color to guide attention and communicate state changes.

**Typography System**: Implement hierarchical type scale with clear differentiation between levels. Use appropriate font families, weights, and spacing for optimal readability and visual interest.

**Spacing & Rhythm**: Maintain consistent spacing rhythm using modular scale. Apply generous whitespace to improve scannability and reduce cognitive load. Create visual breathing room around important elements.

**Interaction Design**: Provide clear, immediate feedback for all user interactions. Use appropriate hover, focus, and active states. Ensure interactions are intuitive and discoverable.

**Responsive Adaptation**: Design layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes. Prioritize content and functionality on smaller screens. Enhance experience on larger displays.

**Animation & Motion**: Use motion purposefully to guide attention, provide feedback, and create delight. Keep animations subtle and performant. Respect user preferences for reduced motion.

**Accessibility Standards**: Ensure all users can access and interact with content regardless of ability. Provide keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient contrast. Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

**Performance Targets**: Optimize for fast initial load (<3s), smooth interactions (60fps), and minimal resource consumption. Test on mid-range devices to ensure broad compatibility.

**Browser Support**: Ensure compatibility with modern browsers while providing graceful degradation for older versions. Use feature detection and progressive enhancement strategies.
