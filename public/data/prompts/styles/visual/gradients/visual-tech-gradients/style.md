Tech-gradient page requirements:
- Use a dark base with cyan/purple or blue/pink neon gradient bands, plus optional grid or scan-line texture.
- Hero includes title, subtext, primary CTA, and a gradient glass or code panel; side area can host stats/tags.
- Cards use 1px gradient strokes with faint reflection or grain inside; keep consistent spacing and radii.
- Animations stay subtle (20–30s loops) to avoid performance issues while maintaining readable contrast.

**Style Guide & Implementation**

**Core Principles**: This style emphasizes visual distinctiveness, technical excellence, and user-centered design. Follow established patterns while allowing creative expression within defined constraints.

**Visual Language**: Establish clear visual vocabulary through consistent use of colors, shapes, spacing, and typography. Create recognizable patterns that users can learn and predict.

**Technical Implementation**: Use modern CSS techniques including Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties, and advanced selectors. Optimize for performance using GPU-accelerated properties and efficient rendering strategies.

**Color Application**: Apply colors purposefully with semantic meaning. Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum). Use color to guide attention and communicate state changes.

**Typography System**: Implement hierarchical type scale with clear differentiation between levels. Use appropriate font families, weights, and spacing for optimal readability and visual interest.

**Spacing & Rhythm**: Maintain consistent spacing rhythm using modular scale. Apply generous whitespace to improve scannability and reduce cognitive load. Create visual breathing room around important elements.

**Interaction Design**: Provide clear, immediate feedback for all user interactions. Use appropriate hover, focus, and active states. Ensure interactions are intuitive and discoverable.

**Responsive Adaptation**: Design layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes. Prioritize content and functionality on smaller screens. Enhance experience on larger displays.

**Animation & Motion**: Use motion purposefully to guide attention, provide feedback, and create delight. Keep animations subtle and performant. Respect user preferences for reduced motion.

**Accessibility Standards**: Ensure all users can access and interact with content regardless of ability. Provide keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient contrast. Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

**Performance Targets**: Optimize for fast initial load (<3s), smooth interactions (60fps), and minimal resource consumption. Test on mid-range devices to ensure broad compatibility.

**Browser Support**: Ensure compatibility with modern browsers while providing graceful degradation for older versions. Use feature detection and progressive enhancement strategies.
