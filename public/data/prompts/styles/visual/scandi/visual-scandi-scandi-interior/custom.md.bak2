Design a “Scandi Interior” page in TailwindCSS. Celebrate light wood, soft whites, foggy grays, and warm beige accents. The vibe is airy, functional, and quietly cozy—no clutter, no heavy gloss. Include a hero, project/room cards, materials & palette chips, services/process, testimonials, and clear CTAs.

Visual language
- Palette: off-white (#F8F7F4), light gray (#E6E5E1), pale beige (#E9DDCE), light oak (#D7C5A3), graphite text (#2E2A26), and a muted accent (sage/dusty blue) for small highlights.
- Surfaces: matte, soft shadows (`shadow-sm`), thin borders in warm gray (`border-amber-900/10`). Optional subtle grain/noise to mimic natural material.
- Shapes: gentle radii (12–16px) on cards, pill chips. Avoid sharp edges and glossy effects.
- Imagery: bright, natural-light photography showing uncluttered rooms, plants, textiles.

Layout blueprint
- Navigation: clean top bar with wordmark, sections (Rooms, Materials, Services, Journal, Contact), and a rounded CTA (“Book consult”). Add light hover underline.
- Hero: large headline about calm functional interiors, subhead (2–3 lines), and dual CTAs (primary filled accent, secondary outline). Pair with room photo or collage of furniture pieces on a muted background; include a small badge (e.g., “Free 30-min call”).
- Project cards: 6–9 room/project tiles with image, room type/size, short description, and tags (Minimal, Family, Workspace). Use consistent aspect ratio (`aspect-[4/3]`), `rounded-2xl`, light border, and subtle hover lift.
- Materials & palette: chips or swatches for wood, fabric, metal. Include short notes (“Matte oak,” “Bouclé fabric,” “Black powder-coated steel”). Add a compact comparison table (warmth, durability).
- Services/process: 4-step strip (Consult → Plan → Curate → Install) with simple icons and microcopy. Add lead time and service area badges.
- Testimonials: 2–3 quotes with portrait circles, name, and room type. Keep typography light and airy.
- Journal/guide preview (optional): small cards for “Lighting layers”, “Small-space storage”, “Textile care” with read time and “Read guide” link.
- CTA/footer: closing block with primary CTA (“Start a project”) and secondary (“See packages”). Include contact, social, and service hours.

Typography
- Use a humanist sans or soft geometric sans. Headings 600–700 weight; body 16–17px at 1.6–1.7 line height. Labels in small uppercase with letter spacing for section intros.
- Keep text alignment left; center only brief hero statements. Balance long headings with `text-balance`.
- Use tabular numbers for prices or room sizes if needed.

Components & states
- Buttons: rounded (`rounded-full` or `rounded-lg`) with accent fill; outline variant in warm gray. Hover: gentle tint shift and slight lift. Focus-visible outline 2–3px.
- Cards: `rounded-2xl border border-amber-900/10 bg-white/90 p-5 md:p-6 shadow-sm transition hover:-translate-y-1`. Allow optional top accent bar or corner dot.
- Chips: soft pill chips for tags (“Nordic”, “Compact”, “Family-safe”) with muted text and subtle border.
- Inputs: `rounded-xl border border-amber-900/10 bg-white px-4 py-3 shadow-inner/none` with clear focus ring. Keep labels visible.
- Dividers: thin lines in warm gray at low opacity; optional dotted lines for secondary separation.

Motion
- Calm and minimal: 160–220ms ease-out, small translate/opacity. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Avoid flashy animations.

Accessibility
- Contrast: ensure dark text on light backgrounds meets 4.5:1. Focus rings visible on all interactive elements. Provide alt text for images and aria-labels for icon-only buttons.
- Do not rely on color alone; pair with text/icons for states. Maintain logical tab order and hit targets ≥ 44px.

Responsive behavior
- Mobile: stack hero and cards; keep gutters 16–20px; CTAs full-width. Allow horizontal scroll for material chips with scroll hint.
- Tablet: 2-column grids; hero image above/beside text; maintain generous spacing.
- Desktop: 3-column grids, `max-w-6xl/7xl` container with 24–32px gutters; allow asymmetric layout with whitespace for breathing.

Content guidance
- Tone: calm, approachable, functional. Emphasize light, warmth, and practicality.
- CTA microcopy: “Start a project,” “Book consult,” “See packages,” “View materials.”
- Provide metadata: room size, budget range, lead time, materials used. Keep descriptions concise and benefit-focused.

Tailwind helper suggestions (non-binding)
- Container: `mx-auto max-w-6xl px-6 lg:px-10`
- Hero grid: `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-10 items-center`
- Card base: `rounded-2xl border border-amber-900/10 bg-white/90 p-6 shadow-sm transition hover:-translate-y-1`
- Buttons: `inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full px-5 py-3 font-semibold transition focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2`
- Chips: `rounded-full border border-amber-900/20 bg-white/70 px-3 py-1 text-sm`

Deliver a Scandinavian-inspired interior page that feels bright, warm, and functional—light wood, airy grids, honest materials—while keeping accessibility and readability paramount.
