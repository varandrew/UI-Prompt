---

Build a “Fluent 2 Notification Center” page in TailwindCSS. Embrace Fluent 2 traits: soft corners, subtle depth, clear strokes, layered translucency used sparingly, calm gradients, and accessible contrast. Focus on information clarity and actionable controls for notifications/preferences.

**Layout & Flow**
- Hero: headline 38–52px, subhead 16–18px, primary CTA (e.g., “Enable alerts”) and secondary (“Manage rules”). Use a light neutral or soft gradient background with a single illustration/spot; keep text contrast high.
- Notification digest: grid or list of cards (4–8). Each card shows source, title, short body, timestamp, severity badge, and quick actions (mute/pin/mark read). Provide filter/sort controls above the list.
- Preference matrix: two-column section with toggles or checkboxes per channel (Email/Push/SMS/In-app) and category (Security, Billing, Product). Include a “Mute schedule / Do Not Disturb” block.
- Activity log: tabular list with 1px dividers, sticky header, monospace timestamps, and status icons. Provide bulk actions (Mark all read, Clear).
- Closing CTA: reassure privacy and control; link to “Privacy settings” or “Export data.”

**Visual Language (Fluent 2)**
- Surfaces: light neutrals with soft elevation. Use `shadow-sm`/`shadow-md` equivalents; avoid harsh shadows. Strokes at 8–12% opacity for cards/panels.
- Corners: 8–12px radius; consistent across buttons, cards, inputs. Use inner padding 16–24px.
- Color: primary accent (blue/teal) with desaturated supporting tones; status colors for success/info/warn/critical aligned with Fluent guidance. Gradients are gentle (two-stop, low contrast).
- Icons: simple, line or duotone; pair with text. Avoid dense icon-only rows.

**Typography**
- Headings 600–700 weight; body 15–16px, line-height 1.6–1.7. Labels in small caps or semi-bold. Numbers/timestamps in monospace for alignment.
- Keep line lengths reasonable; use `text-balance` for long headings if available.

**Components & States**
- Buttons: pill/squircle radius, filled primary + ghost secondary. Hover = tint shift; active = slight press; focus-visible outline 2–3px in accent. Allow icon-leading variants for “Mute” or “Filter.”
- Toggles/checkboxes: smooth transitions (140–200ms), clear on/off contrast, focus ring. Provide labels on the right; avoid icon-only toggles.
- Chips/badges: soft corners, gentle fills for status (info/success/warn/critical). Include text labels, not color-only.
- Cards: `border border-slate-200/70 bg-white shadow-sm rounded-xl` with ample spacing; optional top accent bar for category.
- Tables/lists: `divide-y` lines, hover row tint subtle; selection states with clear focus ring and checkbox alignment.

**Motion**
- Calm, purposeful: fade/translate 120–180ms ease-out. No bounce. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; disable row hover lift on touch/coarse pointers.
- Micro-interactions: toggles/checkboxes animate fill/knob; buttons press 1–2px.

**Accessibility**
- Contrast ≥ 4.5:1 on text; status colors paired with icons/text. Focus styles always visible. Hit targets ≥44px. Provide aria-labels for controls and alt text for illustrations.
- Do not rely on color alone for severity; include labels (Info/Warning/Error) and icons.

**Copy Tone**
- Reassuring, clear, control-focused. Examples: “Stay informed, not overwhelmed.” “Choose when and how we notify you.” “Silence on schedule.”
- CTA examples: “Enable alerts”, “Review channels”, “Open privacy center.”

**Tailwind Hints (reference)**
- Container: `max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-10 py-16 lg:py-24`
- Surfaces: `rounded-xl border border-slate-200/70 bg-white shadow-sm` with `backdrop-blur-[2px]` only if needed and contrast-safe.
- Buttons: `rounded-full px-5 py-3 font-semibold transition hover:shadow-md active:translate-y-[1px] focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2`
- Toggles: `peer` + `peer-checked:` patterns; use `ring` utilities for focus.
- Lists/Tables: `divide-y divide-slate-200 text-sm leading-6 font-mono` for logs; `grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2` for notification cards.
