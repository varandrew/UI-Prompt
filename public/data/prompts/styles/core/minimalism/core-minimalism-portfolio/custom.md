## 中文版本 (zh-CN)

请使用 TailwindCSS 创建「极简作品集」页面，延续 minimalism 家族：纯净留白、单色或少量中性色、清晰网格、克制字体。包含 Hero、代表案例/专案卡片、关于/履历摘要、服务与 CTA，强调可读性与秩序。

Design a “Minimalist Portfolio” in TailwindCSS. Strip away everything unnecessary: abundant white space, neutral palette (white, off-white, light gray, charcoal), precise grids, and disciplined typography. No gradients, no decorative shadows; hierarchy is driven by spacing, weight, and alignment. Include a hero, project highlights, a case study band, about/resumé snapshot, services, testimonials (optional), and a confident CTA.

Design principles
- Palette: monochrome or near-monochrome neutrals; one subtle accent (muted blue/green) for links/CTAs if needed. Keep backgrounds mostly white/off-white.
- Depth: minimal shadows; rely on `border` and spacing. Use 1px lines at low opacity for structure.
- Grid: 12-column base with 24–32px gutters on desktop; collapse to 6/4/2 columns on smaller screens. Consistent vertical rhythm (64–96px between sections).
- Alignment: left-aligned text; avoid center-heavy layouts except for brief hero moments. Keep line lengths 60–72ch for body.
- Motion: gentle fades/translate (120–180ms ease-out); no bounce or scale. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Layout blueprint
- Navigation: simple bar with wordmark and anchor links (Work, Services, About, Contact). Include a small outline button for “Download CV” or “Start project”; visible focus ring required.
- Hero: concise headline (38–52px), a two-line subhead, and dual CTAs (primary filled or bold text link; secondary outline). Optionally include a single grayscale portrait or abstract line illustration aligned to the grid.
- Project highlights: 6–9 cards or tiles with consistent aspect ratios (`aspect-[4/3]`), each listing title, role, year, and a one-line outcome. Hover reveals a light outline and small arrow. Provide “View case study” link for each.
- Featured case study band: a split layout with a large image mock (grayscale or muted) on one side and text stack on the other: problem, approach, result (ideally numeric). Include a CTA to read the full story.
- About/resumé snapshot: two columns—bio on the left; key facts on the right (location, availability, skills, tools, awards). Add a download CV link styled as an outlined pill.
- Services: 3–4 concise cards describing capabilities (Brand systems, UI/UX, Design systems, Frontend). Use subtle dividers and microcopy.
- Testimonials (optional): 2–3 quotes in understated blocks with name/role and small avatar ring. Keep tone calm and factual.
- CTA/footer: closing invitation with primary action (“Start a project”) and secondary (“View availability”). Add minimalist social links (outline icons) and contact email.

Typography
- Use a modern sans; headings 600–700 weight, body 16–17px at 1.6–1.7 line height. Consider small caps/letter-spaced labels for section headings.
- Balance text using `text-balance` for multi-line headings. Keep subheads narrower than body width to add tension.
- Use monospace only for metadata (year, platform) if desired for alignment.

Components & states
- Buttons: rectangle or pill with 1px stroke; hover darkens text/stroke slightly. Focus-visible outline 2–3px in neutral accent.
- Cards: `rounded-xl border border-neutral-200 bg-white p-5 md:p-6 shadow-none`; hover `-translate-y-1` with `border-neutral-300`.
- Chips/tags: minimalist outline pills with uppercase microcopy; no heavy fills.
- Inputs: `border border-neutral-300 rounded-lg bg-white px-4 py-3` with clear focus ring; labels always visible (no placeholder-only).
- Tables/lists: use `divide-y divide-neutral-200`; keep icons minimal or absent.

Imagery
- Keep images grayscale or lightly muted; consistent aspect ratios; no heavy filters. Avoid busy collages; prioritize clarity.
- If text overlays images, add subtle scrim for readability and maintain 4.5:1 contrast.

Accessibility
- Contrast: ensure body text meets ≥ 4.5:1; links/CTAs clearly visible. Do not rely on color alone for states; pair with text or icons.
- Keyboard: all controls focusable with visible ring; logical tab order. Provide alt text for all images and aria labels for icon-only items.
- Hit targets ≥ 44px.

Responsive behavior
- Mobile: single-column flow; stack hero with CTAs full-width; allow horizontal scroll for tags if necessary with visible scroll cues.
- Tablet: 2-column project grids; keep nav readable; maintain generous spacing.
- Desktop: `max-w-6xl/7xl` container with consistent gutters; allow asymmetric compositions but anchored to the grid.

Content guidance
- Copy tone: concise, confident, factual. Lead with outcomes (“Shipped design system for 50+ teams,” “Increased conversion +12%”).
- Case cards: include Role, Scope, Year, Outcome. Avoid long paragraphs; keep summaries scannable.
- CTA microcopy: “Start a project,” “View case study,” “Download CV,” “Check availability.”

Tailwind helper suggestions (non-binding)
- Container: `mx-auto max-w-6xl px-6 lg:px-10`
- Section spacing: `py-16 lg:py-24`
- Cards: `rounded-xl border border-neutral-200 bg-white p-6 transition hover:-translate-y-1`
- Buttons: `inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full border border-neutral-900 px-5 py-3 font-semibold transition focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2`
- Dividers: `h-px bg-neutral-200`

Deliver a minimalist portfolio that communicates expertise through clarity, spacing, and typographic hierarchy, not decoration.
