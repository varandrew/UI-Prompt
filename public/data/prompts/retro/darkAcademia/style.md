## 中文版本 (zh-CN)

角色设定：你是一名热爱古籍与人文研究的设计师，需要向产品团队解释 Dark Academia 暗黑学院家族的界面氛围。

场景定位：这种风格适用于文学 / 研究型个人博客、学术平台的长文阅读页、图书馆 / 书店专题页以及写作工具的沉浸式阅读模式，让用户感觉自己坐在旧书房里写作或做笔记。

视觉设计理念：画面以深棕木纹或书架为背景，中央悬浮一到两块羊皮纸质感的内容卡片，用于承载标题与正文。整体布局偏传统书页，而非现代栅格化卡片列表，顶部可以有低调的导航或书封式标题，下方是连续的正文与少量分栏信息。

材质与质感：背景展示深色木材、旧墙或满架书脊的层次，细节略微模糊以保护文字可读性；内容卡片呈现温暖的米黄色纸张，边缘可有轻微磨损与色差。局部点缀蜡封、羽毛笔、墨水瓶或手写页角等元素，强化「书写现场」感。

交互体验：交互反馈应极其克制，链接与按钮在悬停时只做轻微提亮或出现细线下划线，卡片 hover 时可以轻微擡升并加深阴影，仿佛纸张被指尖托起。若有光晕闪烁或粒子飘动，频率应很低，让用户可以静下心来长时间阅读。

整体氛围：Dark Academia 家族围绕「安静、自省、偏古典的人文氛围」展开，让界面像一间被书与灯光包围的私人书房。用户一眼看到的不是科技感，而是一种适合阅读、思考和写作的庄重环境。

## English Version (en-US)

Role: You are a designer who loves old books and humanistic studies, and you need to explain the Dark Academia family to the product team.

Scene: This style works well for literary or research blogs, long-form reading views on academic platforms, special pages for libraries or bookstores and focused writing modes. It should feel like sitting alone in a study, surrounded by shelves and warm lamps.

Visual philosophy: The composition uses a dark wood or bookshelf background with one or two parchment-like content cards floating in the center. The layout feels closer to a classical book page than a modern card grid. A modest header might resemble a book cover, with continuous body text and occasional side notes below.

Material and texture: Background imagery shows wood grain, old walls or rows of book spines with slightly blurred detail. Content cards have warm beige tones, with subtle wear and variation at the edges. Wax seals, quill pens, ink bottles or scribbled annotations may appear as small decorative cues to the act of reading and writing.

Interaction experience: Interactions are soft and understated. Links and buttons only brighten slightly or gain a fine underline on hover; cards may lift a few pixels and deepen their shadows as if picked up from the table. Any glow flickers or dust particles should move slowly so users can comfortably read for long stretches.

Overall mood: The Dark Academia family centers on a quiet, introspective and somewhat classical academic mood. Instead of technology or speed, it foregrounds books, thought and time, making the interface feel like a private study turned into a UI.
