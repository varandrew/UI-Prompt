## English Version (en-US)

Swiss Design (International Typographic Style) emphasizes clarity, order, and restraint. Use a strict grid system, generous white space, and clean sans-serif typography. Palette is primarily black and white with limited Swiss-red accent for emphasis on labels or dividers. Asymmetry is welcome as long as the underlying grid remains disciplined. Surfaces stay flat—no heavy shadows, gradients, or textures. Hierarchy is driven by type scale, weight, and spacing rather than decoration. Section labels often use uppercase with tight tracking; body text remains highly readable with comfortable line length and line height. Images should be monochrome or muted and framed by thin strokes and concise captions; avoid busy overlays. Buttons and chips are minimal outlines or simple fills; focus states must be obvious. Motion, if any, is subtle and fast. The layout should feel objective, factual, and confident—lead with information, not ornament—while maintaining accessibility: strong contrast, clear focus rings, semantic structure, and keyboard-friendly navigation across breakpoints.
