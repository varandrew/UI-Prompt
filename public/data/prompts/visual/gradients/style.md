渐变风格指南：
- 使用 3-4 种主色构成线性/径向渐变叠加，避免彩虹杂乱，可叠加轻微噪点。
- 背景可采用大角度渐变或径向光晕，前景卡片用纯色或弱渐变，与背景形成层次。
- 保持大字号标题与充足留白，网格对齐；按钮与标签可用渐变描边或渐变填充。
- 交互态用色相/亮度渐变过渡，动画 200-300ms 内完成，确保可访问性对比。

Gradient style guide:
- Compose 3–4 core colors into layered linear/radial gradients; avoid rainbow clutter and add light grain if needed.
- Use bold angled or radial gradients for the background; foreground cards stay flat or lightly graded for contrast.
- Keep large headings, ample whitespace, and grid alignment; buttons/chips may use gradient strokes or fills.
- Hover/focus transitions shift hue/brightness within 200–300ms while preserving accessibility contrast.

**Style Guide & Implementation**

**Core Principles**: This style emphasizes visual distinctiveness, technical excellence, and user-centered design. Follow established patterns while allowing creative expression within defined constraints.

**Visual Language**: Establish clear visual vocabulary through consistent use of colors, shapes, spacing, and typography. Create recognizable patterns that users can learn and predict.

**Technical Implementation**: Use modern CSS techniques including Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties, and advanced selectors. Optimize for performance using GPU-accelerated properties and efficient rendering strategies.

**Color Application**: Apply colors purposefully with semantic meaning. Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum). Use color to guide attention and communicate state changes.

**Typography System**: Implement hierarchical type scale with clear differentiation between levels. Use appropriate font families, weights, and spacing for optimal readability and visual interest.

**Spacing & Rhythm**: Maintain consistent spacing rhythm using modular scale. Apply generous whitespace to improve scannability and reduce cognitive load. Create visual breathing room around important elements.

**Interaction Design**: Provide clear, immediate feedback for all user interactions. Use appropriate hover, focus, and active states. Ensure interactions are intuitive and discoverable.

**Responsive Adaptation**: Design layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes. Prioritize content and functionality on smaller screens. Enhance experience on larger displays.

**Animation & Motion**: Use motion purposefully to guide attention, provide feedback, and create delight. Keep animations subtle and performant. Respect user preferences for reduced motion.

**Accessibility Standards**: Ensure all users can access and interact with content regardless of ability. Provide keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient contrast. Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

**Performance Targets**: Optimize for fast initial load (<3s), smooth interactions (60fps), and minimal resource consumption. Test on mid-range devices to ensure broad compatibility.

**Browser Support**: Ensure compatibility with modern browsers while providing graceful degradation for older versions. Use feature detection and progressive enhancement strategies.
